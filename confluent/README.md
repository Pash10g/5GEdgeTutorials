# Confluent on Verizon 5G Edge
Get started on Confluent with Verizon 5G Edge today using AWS Wavelength, Confluent for Kubernetes, and any Verizon 4G, 5G, or CAT-M IoT device.

In this tutorial, use Terraform to deploy Confluent for Kubernetes to AWS Wavelength.

## Getting Started
1. Fork the code repository for the [Confluent<>5G Edge Terraform module](https://github.com/verizon/5GEdgeTutorials.git)

```
git clone https://github.com/verizon/5GEdgeTutorials.git
cd 5GEdgeTutorials/confluent/terraform
```

2. Next, initialize Terraform within your working directory and create a preview of your deployment changes.

```
terraform init
terraform plan
```

3. Next, edit `terraform.tfvars` with any specific configuration details, such as your EKS cluster name, and specific Wavelength Zone(s) of interest. Note that attributes `domain` and `zoneid` are specifically for AWS Route53, if you'd like to automatically create a subdomain for your Confluent cluster endpoints.

4. Apply the configuration by running `terraform apply.`
